# weatherdashboard

For this assignment, I was challenged to create a dynamic weather dashboard which will show present temperature as well as a five day forecast with a corresponding icon. I found this to be very challenging when it came to working with the API's and getting it to successfully show certain aspects of the weather such as the UV index.

As you can see from the screenshot above, I was able to display the time, weather, and an icon. 

However, I was unable to get it to return the five day forecast. I plan on making adjustments as soon as possible to get it to properly display.
